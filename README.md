Types of UCR Accounts & Functions
UCR Seller Account: A free seller account is the main account to mint and generate carbon credits from project activities. The seller account is designed to be operated by project owners and their aggregators. This type of account has many additional features, as opposed to other UCR accounts within the ecosystem, with features related to uploading project information, audit reports, documentation etc, to enable project developers/owners and their authorized consultants, to register and generate carbon credits under the UCR CoU program.
______________________
The UCR Seller Account is also capable of listing credits on any 3rd party spot exchange platform (e.g CTX) or transferring credits to buyers who have contacted the seller directly to enable a trade without going onto a third-party exchanges (OTC trading) or directly retiring credits on behalf of customers/clients. In adherence to the global voluntary carbon market principles, any trading from the UCR seller account means that the parties involved are primary traders of credits. The flow of carbon credits is always outward post issuance of credits by UCR into the seller account.

UCR Buyer Account: A free buyer account is the main account to complete inter registry transfers, setup holding accounts for blockchain plays and retire carbon credits. The buyer account is designed to be operated by secondary market traders and buyers. This type of account has limited features, as opposed to UCR seller accounts within the ecosystem, with features related to secondary trading of carbon credits.

Having credits in the buyer account means that the account holder has either engaged in OTC trades with primary sellers or has purchased credits from a linked UCR exchange.

UCR buyer account cannot resend credits back to any seller accounts, to do so would require the seller to open a buyer account. Account opening is free!

The UCR Buyer Account is also capable of listing/relisting credits on any 3rd party spot exchange platform (e.g CTX) or transferring credits to other buyer accounts or directly retiring credits or mapped for the burn and tokenize API. In adherence to the global voluntary carbon market principles, any trading from the UCR buyer account means that the parties involved are secondary traders of credits. The flow of carbon credits is always within the buyer and trader ecosystem on the UCR platform.

Tips

Carbon credits are not perishable environmental attributes or commodities or instruments. They are digital certificates (not to be confused with RECs or Ecerts), showcasing the reduction, avoidance or abatement of carbon dioxide in units of 1 tonne and come with inbuilt metadata that can be extracted from its digital signature which can assist in tracing its origin, vintage, project type etc. Each credit is unique and traceable within the registry.
________________
Credits in your UCR account means that you are the owner of the credits.

While trading on spot exchanges, the vintage, type and volume determine prices.
________________
It’s always preferred to price low and then increase the same based on demand as opposed to pricing the credits high at initial listing and then slashing prices.

Just like trading in shares, wherein traders must have demat accounts, in trading carbon credits, you need to have a registry account. Once you transfer or trade on any 3rd party spot exchange or simply retire credits from your UCR account, the credits are instantaneously removed from your account forever, hence you cannot resell the same credit with the same digital signature to multiple buyers (double counting fraud) since you don’t have custody or control of the said credit post the “action” event.

While you can delist credits that have remained unsold on any UCR linked centralized exchange, you cannot delist and return to UCR from any third-party linked blockchain token exchange or play after engaging the UCR burn and tokenize function (this is a one way protocol).

Using the burn and tokenize function entails you to take LIVE UNRETIRED credits “on chain,” and for that the tokenizer needs to map their UCR buyer account and link the APIs to their blockchain token play/s. This also means that tokenized credits would need to be “retired” by the tokenizer on their blockchain platform and not back again on UCR.

UCR is not a blockchain or fintech entity, we are only mandated to enable and assist in the creation of climate actions using DLT and other decentralized methods that can help limit global heating before 2030.

Always remember, unlike other registries and standards in the voluntary carbon market, you DO NOT NEED UCR permission to trade/burn and tokenize or retire credits held in your account. UCR, which has a business model based on the primary issuance of credits from the seller at the minting stage, does not earn or engage in commercial undertakings with third-party exchanges, blockchain trading platforms etc*. The enables UCR to remain non-exclusive to third party carbon plays in the ce-fi or de-fi eco-system and explore all possible revenue generating pathways for sellers in the market.

*Obviously there are API design-linkage fees applicable when mapping specific UCR private third party buyer accounts to private third party exchanges or on-chain plays, and since this requires UCR and its tech team to devote time and resources, such activities are billed to the third party clients as per the agreements agreed to prior to the undertaking. Hence UCR members are never billed for such linkages.
